# ChemPredictor

## Overview

ChemPredictor aims to analyze Molecular Properties of known compounds and construct an advanced Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model capable of accurately predicting these properties for unknown compounds. This project seamlessly integrates the principles of chemistry, mathematics, and Python programming to develop and deploy an ANN model for Molecular Property Prediction (MPP).

### Objectives

1. **Molecular Property Analysis:** Explore the Molecular Properties of known compounds.
2. **ANN Model Construction:** Build a robust Artificial Neural Network model for accurate prediction of molecular properties.
3. **Interdisciplinary Approach:** Integrate concepts from chemistry, mathematics, and programming to enhance the model's effectiveness.
4. **User-Friendly Interface:** Develop an interactive [WebUI using Streamlit](https://example.com/chempredictor) for seamless and user-friendly predictions.
5. **Targeted Properties:** Focus on predicting a set of 9 molecular properties crucial for comprehensive chemical analysis:

    - **Dipole moment (µ):** Measurement of polarity of a molecule.
    - **Electronic polarizability (α):** Tendency of non-polar molecules to shift their electron clouds relative to their nuclei.
    - **Internal energy of atomization (U):** Energy required to break a molecule into separate atoms.
    - **Enthalpy of atomization (H):** Amount of enthalpy change when a compound's bonds are broken, and the component atoms are separated into single atoms.
    - **Free energy of atomization (G):** Extra energy needed to break up a molecule into separate atoms.
    - **Energy of HOMO:** Energy of the highest occupied Molecular Orbital.
    - **Energy of LUMO:** Energy of the lowest unoccupied Molecular Orbital.
    - **Band Gap Energy:** Energy of LUMO – Energy of HOMO.
    - **Heat capacity (Cv):** Amount of heat required to increase the temperature of the molecule by one degree.

### Key Features

- **QM9 Dataset:** Utilize the QM9 dataset—a benchmark in quantum chemistry—for training and testing the model.
- **Libraries Used:** Leverage TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and RDKit for efficient machine learning and chemical informatics.
- **WebUI:** Create an intuitive [WebUI using Streamlit](https://example.com/chempredictor) to facilitate easy predictions and exploration of results.
